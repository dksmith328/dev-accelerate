		<description><![CDATA[Setting your freelance rates: demystified. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[download file=&#8221;wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The-ULTIMATE-Guide-to-Charging-for-Freelance-Web-Design.pdf&#8221; title=&#8221;The Ultimate Guide to Charging for Freelance Work&#8221;]</p>
<h3><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #222222; font-weight: bold;" href="http://skillcrush.com/2014/09/29/skillcrushtv-ruby-pro/" target="_blank">Are you charging too much?</a></h3>
<p>Or not enough?</p>
<p>When you are a freelancer, you set your own prices. There&#8217;s no boss to give you a raise, and no HR manager to negotiate your salary with.</p>
<p>Getting your first couple freelance jobs is exhilarating. Someone is trusting YOU with their business, putting their brand in YOUR hands. It&#8217;s easy to feel like you are the lucky one. <em>They hired ME? But I&#8217;ve only been doing this for a few months!</em></p>
<p>Even so, didn&#8217;t you start this whole freelancing thing so you could up your income? But how can you avoid lowballing your client if you aren&#8217;t sure what fees are standard in the industry?</p>
<p>When it comes to setting your freelance rates, there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all. There are so many questions to consider: <em>How long will the project take? Is the client a breeze to work with? (or not?) How much money do you need to make to turn a profit? How much experience do you have?</em></p>
<p>Skillcrush designer (and experienced freelancer) Kristina Zmaic came up with the ULTIMATE guide to calculating your rates as a freelancer. Below, you&#8217;ll find a free PDF download that will help you decide what to charge, whether you&#8217;re a fresh-faced rookie building custom icons or a long-time WordPress developer.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t let your first clients make you TOO starry-eyed. Enter your email address, download the FREE PDF guide, and calculate a freelance rate that will pay the bills, and then some!</p>
